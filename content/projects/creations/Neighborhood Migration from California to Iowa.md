A future project in which I will investigate the experiences of Chinese migrants to the United States in the 1800s who created large Chinese neighborhoods from California to Iowa. Little is known about these neighborhoods and even less is known about what happened to those who lived in the neighborhood after its death. I explore how these neighborhoods died and how Chinese migrants kept their memories and institutions alive as they moved to new neighborhoods.
