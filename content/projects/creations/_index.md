This page represents the landing page for "projects" section. It is also shown under the homepage header for "projects". It should be therefore relatively short and sweet.

IN the dfault theme, "projects" is divided among "Creations" you authored and "contributions" made to others projects.

Below I illustrate my interest in resistance through my ongoing <a href="/projects/creations">research projects</a>.</p>
