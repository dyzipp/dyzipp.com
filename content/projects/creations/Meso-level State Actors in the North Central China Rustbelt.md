I plan on continuing my research examining meso-level state actors in the North Central China rustbelt. The first series of articles will examine how meso-level officials resourcefully provide stability, manage uncertainty, and develop new relationships with capital, labor, and other bureaucrats as they are instructed to redistribute (limited) wealth under the slogan “common prosperity” while simultaneously trying to economically develop. Relatedly, a second stream of articles will focus on meso-level officials’ efforts to collect taxes through urban redevelopment, increased enforcement of tax laws, and crackdowns on tax evaders.
