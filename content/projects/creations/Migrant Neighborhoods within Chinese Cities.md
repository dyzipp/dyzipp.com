A future project in which I investigate migrant neighborhoods within Chinese cities, following migrant workers from their inland homes in Shanxi and Henan to coastal cities, how they navigate the city, create new neighborhoods and institutions, and react to efforts to remove their neighborhoods, showing the connections between their original homes and their homes in the city.
