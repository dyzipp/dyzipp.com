I am a Collegiate Fellow/Visiting Assistant Professor in <a href="https://universityhonors.umd.edu/personnel/daniel-yoder-zipp/">University Honors</a> at the University of Maryland College Park.  I am also an Affiliate of the <a href="https://socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/zipp/daniel-yoder">Department of Sociology</a> at the University of Maryland College Park.

My research primarily focuses on the political economy of Chinese environmental policy implementation through in-depth qualitative methods. Specifically, my scholarship focuses on the myriad of interests (capital, labor, and other state bureaucrats) that mid-level bureaucrats navigate and create as they (fail) to implement environmental policies in Shanxi and Henan provinces, located on Chinaâ€™s largest coalfield, that are meant to curb coal production, consumption, and pollution. To investigate the interactions between mid-level officials and managers, workers, and other officials, I spent 12 months engaged in comparative ethnographic work, supplemented by 148 semi-structured interviews. The future of global climate change is dependent on whether or not Chinese mid-level officials can faithfully implement environmental policies, therefore understanding the ways that they actively resist implementation is crucial.
