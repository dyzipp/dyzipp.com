We collected and analyzed every instance of migrant workerâ€™s collective action between 2010 and 2013 in the online databases of the China Labour Bulletin and the China Strikes Crowdmap to show that worker resistance within China still occurs mostly outside institutionalized channels and that this resistance must be studied by sector.
